# The purpose of the Import pass is to load more library sources into memory,

# We continue loading source libraries until all imports have been resolved.

# This pass does not mutate the Program topology directly, though it instructs Context to compile more libraries.
# This pass does not mutate the AST.
# This pass may raise a compilation error.
# This pass keeps state at the program level.
# This pass produces output state at the library import level.
