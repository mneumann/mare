##
# The purpose of the Refer pass is to resolve identifiers, either as local
# variables or type declarations/aliases. The resolution of types is deferred
# to the earlier ReferType pass, on which this pass depends.
# Just like the earlier ReferType pass, the resolutions of the identifiers
# are kept as output state available to future passes wishing to retrieve
# information as to what a given identifier refers. Additionally, this pass
# tracks and validates some invariants related to references, and raises
# compilation errors if those forms are invalid.
#
# This pass does not mutate the Program topology.
# This pass does not mutate the AST.
# This pass may raise a compilation error.
# This pass keeps state at the per-type and per-function level.
# This pass produces output state at the per-type and per-function level.
