# Savi Lexer for Rouge

This subdirectory contains source files which are mirrored in the [Rouge repository](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge).

That is, the [Rouge repository](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) forms the vehicle for releasing changes to the public, so any changes made in this subdirectory (apart from this README.md) should be propagated forward to the corresponding files in that repository.

Changes should also be reflected in the other pygments-like lexers that we have tooling for here in the Savi repository, including:
- `tooling/vscode/syntaxes`
- `tooling/pygments`

You'll notice that those other lexers are nearly identical in structure to this one (apart from being written using another language/framework), and we'd like to keep it that way, so please ensure changes are propagated accordingly.
