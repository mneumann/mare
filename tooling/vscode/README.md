[![](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/savi-lang.savi.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=savi-lang.savi)

This extension adds to VS Code syntax highlighting and various Intellisense features for the Savi Programming Language.

## Prerequisites

This extension uses [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) to run the Savi language server in the background, so you'll need to have a working installation of Docker and the ability to `docker run` as a non-root user.
